INTRODUCTION                                        	*deleteto*

WHOLE FILE                                          	*dU* *deleteto-file*

Imagine you're working with a list of files:
>
  ./deleteto/plugin/deleteto.vim
  ./deleteto/README.md
  ./keyword/plugin/keyword.vim
  ./keyword/README.md
<
but you'd like a tidier list without the "./" at the beginning.
Type: "dU/"
>
  deleteto/plugin/deleteto.vim
  deleteto/README.md
  keyword/plugin/keyword.vim
  keyword/README.md
<
Type: *dU/* again
>
  plugin/deleteto.vim
  README.md
  plugin/keyword.vim
  README.md

RANGES                                              	*du* *deleteto-ranges*
