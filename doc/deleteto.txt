INTRODUCTION                                                        *deleteto*

DeleteTo reads a character from the user, then deletes from the beginning of
the line up to and including that character.

If you have a tab delimited file, "dU<tab>" will delete the first column of
data.

See the Workflow section, below, to see what that means.

To improve this plugin, I recommend installing Tim Pope's vim-repeat plugin.
This allows for easy repeat actions of DeleteTo.

WORKFLOW                                                   *deleteto-workflow*

Imagine you're working with a list of files:
>
  ./deleteto/plugin/deleteto.vim
  ./deleteto/README.md
  ./keyword/plugin/keyword.vim
  ./keyword/README.md
<
but you'd like a tidier list without the "./" at the beginning.
Type: "dU/"
>
  deleteto/plugin/deleteto.vim
  deleteto/README.md
  keyword/plugin/keyword.vim
  keyword/README.md
<
Type: "dU/" again
>
  plugin/deleteto.vim
  README.md
  plugin/keyword.vim

MAPPINGS                                   *dU* *duu* *du* *deleteto-mappings*

By default, DeleteTo creates four mappings:
>
  Type       | To work on     | Calls
  ---------- | -------------- | ---------------
  dU         | All lines      | <Plug>DeleteToA
  duu        | This line      | <Plug>DeleteToL
  du{motion} | Motion-defined | <Plug>DeleteToM
  {visual}du | Visual region  | <Plug>DeleteToV
<
You can disable the default mappings with:
>
  let g:deleteto_create_mappings = 0
>
COMMAND                                         *:DeleteTo* *deleteto-command*

The DeleteTo command has the form
>
  :[range]DeleteTo CHAR [COUNT]
<
EXAMPLES                                                   *deleteto-examples*

The delimiter will commonly be forward slash, space, comma or tab.
However, DeleteTo will work with any character.
