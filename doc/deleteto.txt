INTRODUCTION                                                        *deleteto*

DeleteTo reads a character from the user, then deletes from the beginning of
the line up to and including that character.

DeleteUntil is similar, but deletes up to and NOT including the character.
This is analogous to Vim's |f| vs |t| motions.

If you have a tab delimited file, "dU<tab>" will delete the first column of
data.

See the Workflow section, below, to see what that means.

To improve this plugin, I recommend installing Tim Pope's vim-repeat plugin.
This allows for easy repeat actions of DeleteTo and DeleteUntil.

WORKFLOW                                                   *deleteto-workflow*

Imagine you're working with a list of files:
>
  ./deleteto/plugin/deleteto.vim
  ./deleteto/README.md
  ./keyword/plugin/keyword.vim
  ./keyword/README.md
<
but you'd like a tidier list without the "./" at the beginning.
Type: "dU/"
>
  deleteto/plugin/deleteto.vim
  deleteto/README.md
  keyword/plugin/keyword.vim
  keyword/README.md
<
Type: "dU/" again
>
  plugin/deleteto.vim

MAPPINGS                                   *dU* *duu* *du* *deleteto-mappings*

By default, DeleteTo creates four mappings:
>
  Type       | To work on     | Calls
  ---------- | -------------- | ---------------
  dU         | All lines      | <Plug>DeleteToA
  duu        | This line      | <Plug>DeleteToL
  du{motion} | Motion-defined | <Plug>DeleteToM
  {visual}du | Visual region  | <Plug>DeleteToV
<
You can disable the default mappings with:
>
  let g:deleteto_create_mappings = 0
<
                                                        *deleteto-until-mappings*
DeleteUntil does not create default mappings to avoid conflicts with
built-in Vim commands.  The following <Plug> targets are available:
>
  <Plug>DeleteUntilA      All lines
  <Plug>DeleteUntilL      This line
  <Plug>DeleteUntilM      Motion-defined
  <Plug>DeleteUntilV      Visual region
<
Suggested mappings (add to your vimrc):
>
  nmap dI  <Plug>DeleteUntilA
  nmap dii <Plug>DeleteUntilL
  nmap di  <Plug>DeleteUntilM
  xmap di  <Plug>DeleteUntilV
<
COMMANDS                              *:DeleteTo* *:DeleteUntil* *deleteto-command*

The commands have the form
>
  :[range]DeleteTo CHAR [COUNT]
  :[range]DeleteUntil CHAR [COUNT]
<
DeleteTo deletes including the delimiter character.
DeleteUntil deletes up to but not including the delimiter character.

EXAMPLES                                                   *deleteto-examples*

The delimiter will commonly be forward slash, space, comma or tab.
However, DeleteTo will work with any character, including multi-byte
characters.

DeleteTo (inclusive):

  Type this           | Works on               | Delete up to this character
  ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------
  dU/                 | Whole file             | First /
  3dU,                | Whole file             | Third ,
  4duu/               | One line               | Fourth /
  vip2du<tab>         | Visual - paragraph     | Second <tab>
  du9j,               | Motion - 10 lines      | First ,

  :DeleteTo /         | Whole file             | First /
  :1,20DeleteTo /     | Lines 1-20             | First /
  :DeleteTo , 4       | Whole file             | Fourth ,

  :argdo DeleteTo / 2 | All args, all lines    | Second /
  :bufdo DeleteTo \|  | All buffers, all lines | First |

                                                  *deleteto-until-examples*
DeleteUntil (exclusive):

  Given the line:       a/b/c/d

  :DeleteUntil /        Result: /b/c/d    (deleted "a")
  :DeleteUntil / 2      Result: /c/d      (deleted "a/b")
  :DeleteUntil / 3      Result: /d        (deleted "a/b/c")

NOTE                                                             *deleteto-note*

DeleteTo uses |:substitute| internally, so the deleted text is not placed
into any register.  This differs from Vim's built-in |d| command.
